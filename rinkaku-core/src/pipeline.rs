/// and leaves `tests` empty. Filtering happens before
/// `resolve_dependencies`/`build_graph` rather than at render time so test

/// so the set is computed by the caller and passed in as plain data, same
/// as `read_file`. A path in this set is reported as `SkipReason::Generated`
/// unless it was also deleted, in which case `SkipReason::Deleted` wins
/// (checked first): the fact that a file was removed is more important
/// information for a reviewer than an attribute the file no longer carries
/// any content for, and `read_file` is never called either way.
///
/// `include_generated` gates both `generated_paths` (the caller passes an
/// empty set when it's `false`, so this parameter does not duplicate that
/// gating — see `main.rs`'s `resolve_generated_paths`) and, newly, content
/// marker detection (ADR 0011): once a file's source is read (only reached
/// when neither `generated_paths` nor any earlier check already skipped
/// it), `false` runs [`is_generated_content`] over it before parsing and
/// reports `SkipReason::Generated` on a match instead of calling
/// `extract_changed_symbols`. `true` (`--include-generated`) skips this
/// check entirely, matching attribute-based skipping's own opt-out. No
/// local repository being available for `main.rs` to resolve
/// `generated_paths` against does not affect this check, since it only
/// needs file content, not `git check-attr`.
///
/// Known inefficiency: a changed file is parsed here (via
/// `extract_changed_symbols`) and, when `resolver` is `TagsResolver`,
/// parsed *again* while building that resolver's index
/// (`TagsResolver::new` calls `extract_all_symbols` over every tracked
/// file, changed files included). Measured as a minor contributor next to
/// the per-file `git show`/`git ls-files` subprocess cost `--base` mode
/// pays for indexing (see the performance note at the top of `deps.rs`),
/// so left unaddressed for now rather than adding a cache purely on
/// suspicion.
///
/// `read_base_file` (ADR 0014), when `Some`, is used the same way as
/// `read_file` but for a changed file's *base*-side content — mirroring
/// `read_file`'s own shape (a plain closure/fn port, not a trait object) so
/// the two ports read the same way at every call site. See

/// still reporting any `removed` symbols under the new-side `path`; every
/// other kind reads `path` itself. `None` — the pure-stdin-pipe case, where
/// no base commit is known — leaves every symbol's `classification` at its
/// default `None` ("not attempted") and `removed` empty. Beyond the
/// diff-attested `Added` case, this function never guesses a classification
/// from partial information: a `read_base_file` call failing (`Err`, e.g. a
/// transient git failure) is treated as "no base content available" for

/// `Report::tests` beyond what per-file skipping already handles, so
/// `tests` stays empty; a repo-wide "how many test symbols exist" summary
/// was judged non-essential for v1's outline use case — see ADR 0017). A
/// file left with zero symbols after that per-symbol filtering (every

/// `FileReport` — unlike `analyze_diff`, there is no "pure rename with
/// nothing to report but still worth noting" case here (ADR 0017: this
/// mode has no diff, so no rename), so an empty entry would only ever

///
/// Uses [`extract_all_symbols`] (the same function

/// nothing to read, and a base commit that happened to independently
/// contain a same-path file (e.g. a re-add after an unrelated delete)
/// must not be confused for this file's own history. Every other kind
/// (`Modified`, `Renamed`, `Copied`) reads `read_path`'s content via
/// `read_base_file`, extracts every base symbol via
/// [`extract_all_symbols`], and runs [`classify_symbols`] to set
/// `head_symbols`' classification fields in place and collect this file's
/// removed symbols. `read_path` and `report_path` are split because a
/// rename/copy's base content lives at the pre-rename path
/// (`changed_file.old_path`) while a removed symbol should still be
/// reported under the file's current, new-side path — the one path a
/// reviewer looking at this diff actually has open — not the path history
/// happens to read the comparison content from.
///
/// For every non-`Added` kind, a `read_base_file` call failing (`None` port,
/// or an `Err` result — e.g. a transient git failure, or a rename/copy
/// resolving to a base path this repository never actually had) leaves
/// `head_symbols` untouched (`classification` stays `None`, "not
/// attempted") rather than guessing — ADR 0014's "never guess" contract
/// applies to every case except the diff-attested `Added` one above, which
/// isn't a guess at all.
///
/// No-ops (returns an empty `Vec`, `head_symbols` untouched) when
/// `old_changed_ranges` is empty and `head_symbols` is also empty — a pure
/// optimization (nothing from `classify_symbols` could possibly result),
/// sparing a base-content read/parse that would otherwise be pure waste
/// for e.g. a mode-change-only diff.
